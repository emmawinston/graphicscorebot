# Graphic Score Bot
A Tracery Twitter bot, generating graphic scores to inspire musicians, composers, and anyone else.

There are no rules as to how you should use this bot to guide your own music. It will occasionally tweet the words 'BEGIN' and 'END', which can be used as start and end points respectively - or you can completely ignore it. A single graphic can represent a single bar, an entire piece, or anything in between. You can adhere to the lines on the staff, or ignore them. There is no right or wrong, this bot is simply a jumping-off point.

The bot will also occasionally post selections from Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies.

I will gladly share any pieces which are created based on the bot from its account; mention the bot, or email me at emma.winston@gmail.com, and I will post them manually (Cheap Bots Done Quick, which the bot runs on, does not support interactivity, and I don't plan to host it elsewhere at least for now.)

Pull requests, if you have any ideas for the bot, are welcomed (though I will also need to enter these into the hosted bot manually).
